# Finsemble App Catalog

across all available applications, adding the most relevant applications to your app launcher
menu for daily use. Applications are tagged with metadata to make filtering and searching easy.

applications. The Featured Apps section of the catalog shows a rotating selection of
relevant applications.
* App Showcase: The App Showcase section displays detailed information about a
particular application, including a description, release notes of the latest version, release
date, version number, the developer's name, and associated tags.
